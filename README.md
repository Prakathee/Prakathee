### :woman_technologist: About Me :

In the world of data-driven problem-solving, I find my true calling. It's not just about numbers; it's about the stories they tell and the solutions they unveil. I'm passionate about delving into data, dissecting it, and crafting strategies that enhance efficiency and drive decisions that matter.

My journey as a data enthusiast has been an exhilarating one. I thrive on the thrill of analyzing data, extracting valuable insights, and then weaving those insights into a compelling narrative. It's all about making complex information clear and actionable, empowering others to make informed choices.

My foundation in data analytics and data science is strong, and I thrive on using technology to unravel intricate business challenges. But I'm not stopping there. Currently, I'm on a quest to elevate my skills and knowledge by pursuing a Master's in Business Analytics at Santa Clara University. It's a step forward in my mission to excel in data analytics, data science, and business intelligence.

Let's talk about my toolbox. I'm fluent in languages like Python, SQL, R, C++, and C. I wield analysis tools like Jupyter Notebook, R Studio, and the ever-mighty Microsoft Excel. Pivot tables, lookup functions, and macros? They're my allies. When it comes to libraries, you'll find me using nltk, scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, and PySpark. I'm also an artist with data visualization tools like Plotly-Dash, Power BI, Tableau, ggplot2, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Databases? Well, I'm on familiar terms with Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and MySQL.

But that's not all. I bring statistical prowess to the table. Regression, correlation, A/B testing, Chi-Square, time-series analysis‚Äîthey're my tools of choice. Machine learning? I've danced with Linear and Logistic Regression, battled Binary and Multi-class classification, tamed Gradient Descent, and explored the jungles of Decision Trees and Random Forests. I've gone one-on-one with SVM, KNN, and XG Boost. Dimensionality reduction? I've walked the paths of PCA and LDA. Clustering and Market Basket Analysis? Well, they're my playgrounds.

Deep learning? Oh, I've dived into the depths with Long Short Term Memory, surfed the waves of Convolutional Neural Networks, and ventured into the realm of Recurrent Neural Networks. TensorFlow and Keras? They're my companions. Inception V3 and ResNet? I've unlocked their secrets.

And then there's NLP‚ÄîNatural Language Processing. Word2Vec, TF-IDF, N-grams, LDA Topic Modeling, Spacy, and Gensim‚Äîthey're my allies in the realm of language.

But it's not just about the technical skills. Collaboration, storytelling, adaptability, leadership, and problem-solving are the compass points that guide me. These key competencies ensure that my data-driven journeys are not solitary endeavors but collaborative adventures, and that the insights I uncover are not just numbers but stories waiting to be told.
